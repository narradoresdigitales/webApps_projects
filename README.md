# webApps_projects

# Description
Welcome to my Web Application Projects repository! This repository showcases various web applications I've developed using the fundamental web development stack: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project highlights a specific area of front-end development, and together, they demonstrate my skills and experience in building functional and responsive web applications.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to serve as a portfolio for my web development projects. As I continue to build and refine my skills, I will update this repository with new projects. Each project is fully developed and includes detailed documentation regarding its functionality, design choices, and implementation.
